## Problem Statement

Menstrual health issues are often overlooked or dismissed as “normal” or stress-related. Many people struggle to understand changes in their body, and families may lack the language or knowledge to respond empathetically. Haven-and-Her aims to **normalize conversations** about menstrual health and provide clear guidance on what signs matter and when to act. ([prashant-arkm.github.io][1])

---

## How It Works

1. **Home Landing:** Presents the core mission — “You’re not imagining it. And you don’t have to face it alone.” ([prashant-arkm.github.io][1])
2. **Choose Your Path:** Users can select:

   * **For Me** — focus on personal cycle and body changes. ([prashant-arkm.github.io][1])
   * **To Support Someone** — guidance on supporting others with menstrual health concerns. ([prashant-arkm.github.io][1])
3. **Explore Content:** The site then walks users through explanations about common menstrual health topics, early warning signs, and recommended actions. ([prashant-arkm.github.io][1])
